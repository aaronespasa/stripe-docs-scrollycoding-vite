# Prebuilt Checkout page

<CH.Preview frameless>

<Demo />

</CH.Preview>

Explore a full, working code sample of an integration with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout). The client- and server-side code redirects to a pre-built payment page hosted on Stripe.

Before you get started, confirm the payment methods you want to offer in your [payment method settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). We enable cards and other common payment methods for you by default, and we recommend that you enable additional payment methods that are relevant for your business and customers.

## 1️⃣ Set up the server

### Install the Stripe Python package

Install the Stripe package and import it in your code. Alternatively, if you're starting from scratch and need a requirements.txt file, download the project files using the link in the code editor.

```py server.py focus=11:15 mark=11:15
```

---

### Create a Checkout Session

Add an endpoint on your server that creates a [Checkout Session](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions). A Checkout Session controls what your customer sees on the payment page such as line items, the order amount and currency, and acceptable payment methods. We enable cards and other common payment methods for you by default, and you can enable or disable payment methods directly in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).

```py server.py focus=26:37 mark=26:37
```

---

### Define a product to sell

Always keep sensitive information about your product inventory, such as price and availability, on your server to prevent customer manipulation from the client. Define product information when you create the Checkout Session using [predefined price IDs](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=checkout#create-product-prices-upfront) or on the fly with [price\_data](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-line_items-price_data).

```py server.py focus=27:33 mark=27:33
```

---

### Choose the mode

Checkout has three modes: payment, subscription, or setup. Use payment mode for one-time purchases. Learn more about subscription and setup modes in the docs.

```py server.py focus=34 mark=34
```

---

### Supply success and cancel URLs

Specify URLs for success and cancel pages - make sure they're publicly accessible so Stripe can redirect customers to them. You can also handle both the success and cancelled states with the same URL.

```py server.py focus=35:36 mark=35:36
```

---

### Redirect to Checkout

After creating the session, redirect your customer to the URL for the Checkout page returned in the response.

```py server.py focus=41 mark=41
```

---

## 2️⃣ Build your checkout

### Add an order preview page

Add a page to show a preview of the customer's order. Allow them to review or modify their order - as soon as they're sent to the Checkout page, the order is final and they can't modify it without creating a new Checkout Session.

```js App.js focus=6:15 mark=6:15
```

---

### Add a checkout button

Add a button to your order preview page. When your customer clicks this button, they are redirected to the Stripe-hosted payment form.

```js App.js focus=16:20 mark=16:20
```
